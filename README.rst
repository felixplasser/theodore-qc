Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~
* You can obtain the newest TheoDORE release from `github releases <https://github.com/felixplasser/theodore-qc/releases>`_.
* Alternatively, to get the current development version of the code and test suite, run

::

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/felixplasser/theodore-qc.git
    git clone https://github.com/felixplasser/theo-test.git

* To run TheoDORE, setup ``PATH`` and ``PYTHONPATH`` as explained in the `installation instructions <https://theodore-qc.sourceforge.io/docs/installation.html>`_.

Usage
~~~~~
A detailed description of the usage is given `here <https://theodore-qc.sourceforge.io/docs/usage.html>`_.

* As opposed to earlier versions, TheoDORE 3 is activated with a central driver script ``theodore``.
* To get a list of all implemented options simply type

::

    theodore -h

* For input generation

::

    theodore theoinp

* Analysis of transition density matrices

::

    theodore analyze_tden
