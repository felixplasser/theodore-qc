Installation
------------

The installation on a Linux system is split into four simple parts:

Download and extract the source file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Download the newest release TheoDORE_v.s.tgz from the `github releases page <https://github.com/felixplasser/theodore-qc/releases>`_.

Extract the source file

::

    tar -xf TheoDORE_v.s.tgz

Setup the path specification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To use TheoDORE the `PATH` and `PYTHONPATH` variables have to be adjusted. For this purpose you can use the provided bash script `setpaths.bash`

::

    #!/bin/bash
    export THEODIR=/yourpath/TheoDORE/TheoDORE_v.s
    export PATH=$THEODIR/bin:$PATH
    export PYTHONPATH=$THEODIR:$PYTHONPATH


**Note:** `PYTHONPATH` no longer points to the `lib` directory starting in TheoDORE_2.0.

Copy the above lines into your .bashrc file or run:

::

    source setpaths.bash

Alternatively, a csh script setpaths.csh is provided.

Python3
~~~~~~~

TheoDORE 3 is compatible with python3 and no compatibility to python2 is maintained.

The older release, TheoDORE 2.4, is still compatible with python v2.7.14.

External packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following external packages are used by TheoDORE and require a separate instatllation:

    - `python3-numpy <http://numpy.scipy.org/>`_ - for basic numerical manipulations
    - `python3-matplotlib <http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/>`_ *(optional)* - for plotting of graphs
    - `python-openbabel <http://openbabel.org/wiki/Python>`_ *(optional)* - for extended file-parsing capabilities of molecular structure files

    The ``numpy`` and ``matplotlib`` packages are usually readily available with the standard installation tools, e.g. ``apt-get``, ``yum`` etc. Alternatively, they may be downloaded from the URLs specified. If no integrated installation is performed, then it is necessary to add these libraries to the `PYTHONPATH` (see above).

The following external packages are provided along with the TheoDORE distribution in the ``external`` directory.

    - `cclib <http://cclib.github.io/>`_ - For file parsing work. Installation not required, activated via symbolic link from main TheoDORE directory
    - `colt <https://github.com/mfsjmenger/colt>`_ - User interface. Installation not required, activated via symbolic link from main TheoDORE directory
    - `ORBKIT <http://orbkit.github.io/>`_ *(optional)* - For creating cube files of densities. Installation required.

Using anaconda
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A straightforward and universal way of installing most of the required packages is through the use of Anaconda.

First download the `anaconda distribution <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/>`_ and do the installation. Then run the commands:

::

    conda install numpy matplotlib
    conda install -c openbabel openbabel

Testing
~~~~~~~

The tests are invoked with pytest. In the ``EXAMPLES`` directory run (depending on the packages you want to test)

::

    pytest STANDARD
    pytest CCLIB
    pytest EXTRA

The tests are available at the `theodore-test <https://github.com/felixplasser/theodore-test>`_ repository.
